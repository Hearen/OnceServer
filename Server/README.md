### OnceServer API Documentation
This documentation is used to specify the details of the APIs in server side which might be updated when the whole structure comes to its stable state.

#### Methods Calling Mode
1. The client side (a java or web client) would invoke a encapsulated *POST* method to transfer method information and the parameters the method needs to the server; 

2. the server side will automatically dispatch the called method before the data transferred to the normal *eve handling process* in which process the data will be handled in RESTful way and the data will meantime validated according to the *settings.py*. 

3. due to some extra data being enclosed in the request, the *eve module* will prompt failure in data validation and data insertion, so we have to remove the data undefined in *settings.py* before the checking process in *post.py* of *eve* which is always located in /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/eve/\*.

4. another thing should not be ignored is that the uuidString used in creation process (VM, StoragePool, Volumes and VIF and the like) can be ignored in client side which will use a default one to immitate to keep the data part complete but before the mongodb inserting process, the uuidString must be replaced with the actual one which can be generated by either *libvirt* or *UUIDGenerator.py*.

#### VM Methods
- create -- using some parameters to create a VM and return the uuidString to the client if failed return empty string;
- start -- start a VM specified by uuidString and return *Successful!* if failed return *Failed*;
- shutdown -- shut down a VM specified by uuidString and return *Successful!* if failed return *Failed*;
- delete -- delete a VM specified by uuidString and return *Successful!* if failed return *Failed*;
- reboot -- reboot a VM specified by uuidString and return *Successful!* if failed return *Failed*;
- isTemplate -- check a whether a VM is template or not and return *True* if it is otherwise return *False*;
- setTemplate -- set a VM to VM template if this operation done as expected return *True* otherwise *False*;

#### Storage Methods
- createPool -- create a storage pool and return *True* if done successfully otherwise return *False*;
- deletePool -- delete a storage pool and return *True* if done successfully otherwise return *False*;
- listPools -- return a string composed by names of pools created and separated by comma but return *False* if something unexpected happened;
- createVolume -- create a volume and return *True* if done successfully otherwise return *False*; 
- deleteVolume -- delete a volume and return *True* if done successfully otherwise return *False*; 
- listVolumes -- list all volumes in a pool specified by a pool name and return a string composed of names of volumes which is separated by comma but return *False* if something unexpected occurred;

#### VIF Methods
- create -- create a VIF according to the provided parameters return uuidString if created successfully, otherwise return *False*;
- delete -- delete a VIF by its uuidString and return *True* if it is done successfully, otherwise return *False*;
